FROZEN FACTORY - Game Design Document
======================================

CONCEPT
-------
You're a robot running a factory on frozen alien worlds. The cold is relentless -
machines freeze if you can't keep them warm. Generate power, manage heat, harvest
resources, and eventually build super fuel to escape to even harsher planets.


VISUAL STYLE
------------
- Isometric view (like Project Zomboid)
- High-definition pixel art, 32-64px tiles
- Sci-fi industrial aesthetic
- Glowing power lines, steam vents, ice crystals


THE ROBOT (PLAYER)
------------------
- Visible character you walk around with WASD
- Has a personal inventory (limited slots)
- Must physically walk to machines to interact
- Can carry items between machines manually
- Can freeze but has long batteries and low power consumption heaters built in default batteries last 2 cycles but can be upgraded


DAY/NIGHT CYCLE
---------------
- Day lasts 10 real minutes
- Night lasts 15 real minutes
- Sun provides passive heat during day (enough to survive early game)
- Night = no solar heat, machines freeze fast without heaters


TEMPERATURE & FREEZING
----------------------
Machines have temperature states:
  OPTIMAL (green)    - Full speed
  COLD (blue)        - 50% efficiency, warning indicator
  FROZEN (white)     - Completely stopped, takes time to thaw
  OVERHEATED (orange)- Fire risk!
  ON FIRE (red)      - Spreading, will explode

Heat formula:
  Machine Temp = Planet Base + Sun Heat + Heater Heat - Cold Decay

  Sun Heat: +30 during day, 0 at night
  Heater Heat: +20 per nearby heater (heat decays with distance from heater)
  Cold Decay: -5 per second (faster on harder planets)


FIRE SYSTEM
-----------
- Heaters running at max power for 60+ seconds risk catching fire but add a way to cool things like passive cooling (heat sinks, copper wires, etc) and active cooling (fans, moving snow through a pipe, etc)
- Fire spreads to adjacent tiles every 5 seconds
- Burning machines take damage and eventually explode
- Fire Extinguisher Stations auto-suppress fires within 5 tiles
- Player can manually extinguish with E key (unlimited use)


POWER SYSTEM
------------
Solar Panel     - Free power during day, nothing at night
Generator       - Burns coal/fuel, works anytime
Battery         - Stores excess power for nighttime use

Power flows through cables. Unpowered machines won't run.


MACHINES
--------
MINING:
  Miner          - Extracts ore from resource nodes
                   (IMPORTANT: nodes deplete over time, forcing expansion and resource conservation)
  Water Miner    - Drills into ice for water

PROCESSING:
  Furnace        - Smelts ore into ingots
  Assembler      - Crafts parts from processed materials
  Fuel Refinery  - Creates super fuel for planet travel
  024 Refiner    - Unlocked upon reaching Space Rock-024 and should be extremely difficult to get, endgame

HEAT:
  Heater         - Warms nearby machines, uses power, CAN CAUSE FIRES
  Heat Lamp      - Weaker but safer alternative
  Sun Tracker    - A robot that runs around the planet collecting solar and bringing charged batteries back, so you would have a bank that it deposits charged batteries into

SAFETY:
  Fire Extinguisher Station - Auto-fights fires in radius (upgradable with more power for more range)
  Lights - Provide lights for the dark nights

LOGISTICS:
  Conveyor Belt  - Moves items automatically between machines
  Storage Crate  - Holds resources and parts
  Landing Pad    - Required for traveling to other planets
  Pipes          - moves liquids or semi-liquids (snow) (at a slower pace)


RESOURCES
---------
Raw (mined from nodes):
  Iron Ore, Copper Ore, Coal, Crystal, Dark Matter, Quantum Ore

Processed:
  Iron Ingot, Copper Ingot, Steel, Circuits, Engine Parts

Special:
  Super Fuel - Made from rare resources across multiple planets


ECONOMY
-------
Buyers are at fixed locations on the map:
  (be able to buy appropriate things from these people too)
  Scrap Dealer   - Buys raw ore (low prices)
  Parts Merchant - Buys crafted parts (medium prices)
  Collector      - Buys rare items (high prices, specific requests)

Walk to a buyer and interact to sell from your inventory.
Prices fluctuate slightly. Bulk sales get bonuses.


MAP
---
- 512x512 tiles per planet (very large)
- Procedurally generated terrain and resource placement
- WRAPS AROUND - walk off one edge, appear on the opposite side
- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
- Pan camera with middle mouse drag


PLANETS
-------
Travel requires Super Fuel and a Landing Pad.
Each planet is harder than the last:

  TERRA PRIME (Starting Planet)
    Day: 10 min, Night: 15 min
    Resources: Iron, Copper, Coal
    Difficulty: Baseline

  FROST MOON
    Day: 8 min, Night: 17 min
    Resources: Crystal (new)
    Difficulty: Colder base temperature

  SHADOW BELT
    Day: 5 min, Night: 20 min
    Resources: Dark Matter (new)
    Difficulty: Very short days

  ICE GIANT
    Day: 3 min, Night: 22 min
    Resources: Quantum Ore (new)
    Difficulty: Extreme cold, barely any sunlight

  SPACE ROCK-024 (give warning to bring excess power and fuel when going there)
    Day: none, Night: always
    Resources: 024 (nodes are infinite and can be refined down into all different resources)
    Difficulty: Ridiculous, gets even colder than any other planet making machines thaw 50% slower, and making machines freeze 50% faster

PROGRESSION LOOP
----------------
1. Start with basic miner and solar panel
2. Mine resources during the day while sun keeps things warm
3. Build heaters and batteries before first nightfall
4. Expand mining as nodes deplete
5. Set up production chains (ore -> ingots -> parts)
6. Sell products to buyers for currency
7. Buy/craft better machines
8. Build fuel refinery, create super fuel
9. Travel to next planet
10. Repeat with harder conditions and new resources


SAVE SYSTEM
-----------
Auto-saves to browser localStorage every 5 seconds.
Also saves when traveling between planets.
Progress persists between sessions.
